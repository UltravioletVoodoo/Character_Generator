## Description
This is a tool for D&D dungeon masters and players alike to generate fully functional 5th edition characters quickly and with no human decisions required. Characters created are ready to print and play. It was built with input from [ejrbuss](https://github.com/ejrbuss).
## Building and hosting locally
This tool can be accessed anywhere freely on [my personal website](https://ultravioletvoodoo.github.io/Character_Generator/). However, if you want to run this locally you can clone this repository with:
```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/UltravioletVoodoo/Character_Generator.git
```
Then enter the root directory and install the dependencies with:  
```
$ npm install
```
And finally start your local version with:  
```
$ npm start
```
This process will open your local version in your default web browser automatically.
